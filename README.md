Land Taxes / Governance / Death to Anarchy

A bukkit plugin to make town in minecraft an actual thing.

Requirements:

City interacts with Namelayer to run as an autonomous (democratic) organization or despotic autocracy.

Interacts with a bastion (maybe a shopchest?) to make individual plots people can buy. 

Ballot mechanism to put forth simple proposals and allow all land-owning indivudals the right to vote. Configurable to allow variable voting systems. Public/secret ballots. Etc.

Notice board showing new proposals and news on login.

Configurable elections and ability to produce 'roles' with different permission levels.

Ability to set and place borders with new juke alert claim block.

Ability to set up 'tax collection' centers and ATMs that would feed into the town's (digital) coffers. The town's central reserve would be held in a single bank block that must be protected. This bank block can be used to tax, as well as hold citizen diamond (or other configurable item) reserves. Breaking an ATM block would reward the attacker with less than 1% of the total funds in the bank. Breaking the bank block would reward the attacker with 100% of funds.

Ability to distribute funds to proposals. I.e. Vote to give 100 diamonds to new charitable organization, located at plot 20.
